# WavFileHandler
This application is made to change the EndDate CartChunk of incoming Wave files to be the upcoming sunday.
It also includes a CartChunk reader that will display the current start and end dates of the file.
Feel free to take and edit as you please.

Usage is as follows:
1. Browse a directory to watch
2. Browse a directory to send the updated files into
3. Hit the start button

No promises it doesn't choke on your files, there's not any error handling here... Ok, I added some error catching and logging, but still no promises.

Written as a communal project between me and ChatGPT. I know some basic programming fundamentals, but not the specific language. 99% of the coding decisions were made by prompting ChatGPT on the GPT4 model.
